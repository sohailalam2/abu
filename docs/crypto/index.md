# Crypto

The crypto module of [Abu](/) has some pure JS implementation of commonly used hash functions and random id generators.

These modules use the WebCrypto API, its [Browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and its [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/api/webcrypto.html) equivalent to
generate the [random ids](./id-generators.md) and the cryptographic hashes such as [SHA256](./hashing/SHA256Hash.md) and [SHA512](./hashing/SHA512Hash.md).
